HKAiportSchedule

I am trying to write a show scrip to capture the arrival / departure schedule & actually delay for all the flight using HKIA (Hong Kong International Airport).

This is still in progress and feel free to provide your comment. :)

Libraries used are quite common 
* lxml (for html parsing)
* requests (for making HTTP calls)
* pandas (for data manipulation)
